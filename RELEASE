TODO:
* create root directory 'bashdots-x.y.z' in deployed tar
* install via rpm

DONE:
* Added VERSION file.



BashDots-1.0.3, Apr 23, 2006

* Export functions
* Unset variables
* Renamed script to <tt>dots.sh</tt>
* Made alternative 2-file script: <tt>dots-functions.sh</tt> and <tt>dots-completion.sh</tt>


BashDots-1.0.2

* Removed <tt>-d</tt> argument from <tt>complete</tt> because it adds erroneous completions from the current directory.  This however brings back item 1 on the [[#Whish_list]].
* Changed shebang to <tt>#!/bin/bash</tt>


BashDots-1.0.1

* Completion only shows last directory name instead of whole path
* Added tests.
