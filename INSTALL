You can install either a single file cdots.sh (1) or two separate files
cdots-functions.sh and cdots-completion.sh (2).

There are many places to put them. These are a few:

1. As a single file for a single user

   Include cdots.sh from within ~/.bashrc:

       source cdots.sh

2. As separate files for all users

   Copy cdots-functions.sh to /etc/profile.d. Make sure /etc/profile contains
   something like this: 
   
      if test -d /etc/profile.d; then
         for s in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
            test -r $s && . $s
         done
         unset s
      fi
   
   Copy cdots-completion.sh to /etc/bash_completion.d. Make sure /etc/profile
   contains something like this: 
   
      if test -d /etc/bash_completion.d; then
         for s in /etc/bash_completion.d/*.sh ; do
            test -r $s && . $s
         done
         unset s
      fi
